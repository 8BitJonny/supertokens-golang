This is an example of how to integrate [Oso](https://github.com/osohq/go-oso) with SuperTokens (based on [Go-Chi](https://github.com/go-chi/chi)).

The file `db\users.json` contains the pre-configured e-mails with different access rights from the osohq quickstarter.

To start this server, run:
```
go run main.go
